### Why a p5 responsive library?

The idea came about when I started to investigate p5 as a possible method for creating data visualizations and other interactive modules on [my blog](https://github.com/liaprins/curiositycoloredglasses.com){:target="_blank"}. p5 seemed like the perfect candidate, but I needed the sketches I'd be building to scale with the breakpoints that the rest of painstakingly designed site followed. I also wanted to enable full window, maximized views of the sketches, the same way I'd coded all the images to behave.

p5's canvases and drawn elements are pixel-based, so warping them to my site's responsive design while maintaining their relative proportions took some doing, and (for the short term) a second JavaScript file (to account for some of the full-window functionality). Point being, at the moment, the example files, their designed outputs, adn their constants are still formulated to meet the needs of my blog.
